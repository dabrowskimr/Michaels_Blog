		<title>Photo Stream vs. iCloud Photo Library </title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>Photo Stream syncs to your Apple computers, iPads, and iPhones 1000 photos at a time, via the new Photos app </h1>
		<p><em>It's particularly helpful with the great new Photos app, which has been used on iPhones for sometime. iPhoto sucked, Photos replaces that.</em> </p>
		<p>I can't tell you how many times someone has asked me what Photo Stream is vs. the Camera Roll on an iPhone. </p>

		<h2>iCloud Library uses the [Dropbox competitor] iCloud cloud-service </h2>
		

		<h2>I use the Dropbox Camera Upload feature, Dropbox's Carousel App [which makes your photo collection browsing experience more intuitive and pretty], and most recently- My Photo Stream </h2>
