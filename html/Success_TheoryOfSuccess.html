	<h1>Theory of Success </h1>
		<p>only makes sense, if you grant: </p>
		<img src="../img/Desert_EnRoute.jpg" alt="EnRoute" />

	<h2>As long as you can be on an adventure</h2>
		<p> be it in your career, job, relationship, travels, transcendence- and thoroughly enjoy it, and when you get back to normal life if we can call it that- (if not a hyper-traveler-one with irregular), you haven't messed up or neglected what you consider your relationships responsibilites etc etc. And preferably, you enjoy re-entering society as an individual who is not on vacation. </p>

		<p>perhaps putting, for example, a photo of myself on vacation is egotistical.
		it probably is but it's a dimension of what I percieve as success, which may or may not be different from others.</p>

	<h3>(Success actually is determined by you </h3>
		<p>What's this picture say? Proud of myself? Proud of the earth? Sure.) </p>

	<br>	

		<p>I remember struggling to sink into the feeling.. the feeling of- success for me, is being able to travel. That's there, in my mind, when i work hard, push through the bullshit..because I will not settle for less. Not being able to travel- whether that means going to the beach or across the US- would not be a life worth living. <p>

	<h3>And feel progression, at some level, in an upward trajectory </h3>
		<p>natural variation in this is normal, although im inclined to believe you must act (or interpret your behavior) this way more times than not. this feeling is created and accellerated by making a point to do something- anything you deem you want to because you think it's good (the right thing to do, benefits yourself, these will vary)- and then doing it.</p>
		<br>

		<p>(See 7 pillars of self esteem, no more mr nice guy. these resources will begin to allow you to see patterns. That's essentially all they will do, but this is a crucial step.) </p>

	<h3>This + That = Enjoyment of long term progress </h3>
		<p>Of course many add additional components to this, but this is strictly speaking, boiled down, essential. And free thought logically flows out once these conditions are met. What is logical, is goodness, because it's coming from you. </p>

		<p>Now that doesn't mean I believe I'm always right...in practice this unfolds as I assume to be right, unless I clearly dont think im right, until someone says otherwise. </p>

		<p>Ups and Downs; knowing when to kick yourself into gear, and also when to show yourself self-compassion </p> 

	<br>

		<p>When I'm on travel, on vacation, that's a time where I do not feel guilty. I let myself be and merge with reality with life. (having a partner in crime adds another element. One that can highten or destroy things)<p>


	<h3>But when you bring</h3>
		<p>The right little buddy with you <p>

		<p>it's hard to think goodness can't exist </p>
