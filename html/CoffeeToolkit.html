<div class="content">
	<h2>First off, before anyone says anything about this topic- there's already a once sentence answer. </h2><br>
		<p>Cold-brewed concentrate, which you can usually purchase from a good grocery store by the milk. Some taste like medicine so watch out but that's one thing to explore if you don't have any time. </p>

	<h3>Anyways, hopefully you are leaving yourself time in the morning to relax </h3>
		<p>(i.e. getting up near the time you set your alarm to go off), because that is one great way to start your day off on the right foot. </p>

	<h3>The basics are a grinder, teapot - or watter heater, and a french press ##leave this side by side </h3>
			<p>One could argue there are other ways to do this cheaper:
		<ul>
			<li>Is the grinder an option...clearly no </li>
			<li>Is the teapot or water heater and option...NO </li>
			<li>Ding ding ding...you can replace the fp...and there are a million and one ways....Aero, chemex or other pourover, bodum coffee, italian stovetop bialetti... </li>
		</ul>
	
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>But this is the way I chose because there's both 1 the least amount of effortful cleanup, and 2 you can get fancy with it </h3> 


	<p><em>(Clearly I'm talking about my ultra sheek coffee station lol)</em> </p>

	<ol>
		<li>Whole beans are an obvious choice because....just smell freshly ground (preferably of a certain caliber quality) beans and then go sniff some folgers. Do that experiment before you argue with me on this one, honey.</li>
		<li>NEXT grind them...read instructions on grinder...</li>
		<li>Pour grounds into FP</li>
		<li>Pour hot, but not boiling!! water into FP all at once</li>
		<li>If you're fancy let sit for ~5 mins</li>
		<li>If you're in a hurry mix it, the SKIM the top gunk like you're making chicken stock. You should only have to create 1-2 whirlpools, and different coffee beans elicit different amounts of bubbly fuzz gunk</li>
		<li>Wait 5 mins AND POUR</li>
	</ol>

	

	<p>I prefer to drink this with a little milk (mostly to cool it down beccause it's still freaking hot after 5 mins) and nothing else. Oh, sugar if I'm feeling like I want to that day </p>
